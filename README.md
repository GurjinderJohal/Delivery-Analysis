 Delivery Analysis & Customer Retention

A data-driven approach to understanding delivery trends, evaluating marketing effectiveness, and predicting customer churn for local restaurants.

⸻

 Project Overview

Restaurants face numerous challenges—rising costs, stiff competition, and shifting customer behavior. This project uses real delivery data and neighborhood-level economic indicators to provide actionable insights for:
	•	Improving marketing ROI
	•	Targeting high-value neighborhoods
	•	Identifying at-risk customers
	•	Boosting customer retention with predictive modeling

 Key Features

 Weekly Delivery Tracking
Analyze delivery volume trends across 2024 and 2025 to identify seasonality, scheduling needs, and potential revenue gaps.

 Neighborhood Income Mapping
Overlay average household income on city neighborhoods to evaluate the relationship between income and delivery volume.

 Delivery Hotspot Analysis
Generate heat maps of deliveries to evaluate the effectiveness of flyer campaigns and identify underserved areas.

 Inactive Customer Identification
Detect customers who haven’t ordered in the last 6 months and prepare targeted promotions based on historical spending.

 Customer Churn Prediction
Use a Random Forest model to predict which customers are likely to churn—complete with probability scores and performance metrics (e.g., ROC AUC, F1-score).

	•	 Spot trends like reduced orders at the beginning of the month (e.g., due to rent cycles).
	•	 Identify lost customers and re-engage them with personalized offers.
	•	 Use machine learning to proactively reduce customer churn.

⸻

 Tech Stack
 
	•	Python (pandas, scikit-learn, seaborn, folium, matplotlib)
	•	Jupyter Notebooks
	•	GeoJSON for mapping neighborhood boundaries
	•	Excel for exporting customer data and predictions
