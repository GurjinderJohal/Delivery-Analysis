# Delivery-Analysis
Delivery Analysis &amp; Customer Retention Prediction

This project focuses on analyzing weekly delivery data, identifying inactive customers (those who haven't ordered in the last 6 months),
and developing predictive models to estimate the probability of a customer ordering again in the future. Due to sensitive data, the streets 
and addresses used in excel file are fake.

Key Features

    1. Weekly Delivery Analysis
       Analyze total orders, average ticket size, and trends over weekly periods.

    2. Customer Inactivity Detection
       Identify customers who have not placed an order within the past 6 months along with
       their average spending behaviour. Export the list for marketing and promotional
       campaigns. 

    3. Customer Mapping
       Visualize customer locations using geospatial plots to detect delivery patterns and
       underserved regions.

    4. Churn Prediction (Machine Learning)
       Apply supervised machine learning models to predict the likelihood of a customer
       placing future orders based on historical order behaviour 

Motivation & Objectives

Businesses face two challenges:

    1.	Identify inactive customers early to enable targeted re-engagement campaigns.
    2.	Predict future ordering behavior to inform marketing and retention strategy.

This project offers a combined analytical approach to tackle both—backed with visualization and a predictive model.

What You’ll Learn

	•	Pandas & Data Cleaning: Handle missing data, anonymize sensitive information, and prepare for modeling.
	•	Feature Engineering: Extract meaningful indicators—e.g., days since last order, total orders over time windows.
	•	Geospatial Visualization: Plot customer distribution using folium/geopandas.
	•	ML Techniques: Train, evaluate, and tune classifier to predict customer reordering probability.
	•	Export & Integration Readiness: Generate CSV output of inactive customers for downstream systems (like marketing automation tools).
