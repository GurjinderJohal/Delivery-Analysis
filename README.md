Delivery Analysis &amp; Customer Retention Prediction

This project focuses on analyzing weekly delivery data, identifying inactive customers (those who haven't ordered in the last 6 months),
and developing predictive models to estimate the probability of a customer ordering again in the future. Due to sensitive data, the streets 
and addresses used in excel file are fake.

Key Features

1) Weekly Delivery Analysis
  Analyze total orders, average ticket size, and trends over weekly periods.

2) Customer Inactivity Detection
   Identify customers who have not placed an order within the past 6 months along with
   their average spending behaviour. Export the list for marketing and promotional
   campaigns. 

4) Customer Mapping
   Visualize customer locations using geospatial plots to detect delivery patterns and
   underserved regions.

5) Churn Prediction (Machine Learning)
   Apply supervised machine learning models to predict the likelihood of a customer
   placing future orders based on historical order behaviour
